API Platform Site Reliability
Engineer (SRE)
This position is in Zama’s Developer Platform team
Zama recently unveiled the Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol, which
enables confidential smart contracts on top of any blockchain L1 or L2 using
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). The Zama Developer Platform (ZDP) is
our managed gateway that lets internal teams and external developers use the
open-source Zama Protocol through simple, authenticated HTTPS endpoints.
Think Infura or Alchemy, but confidential by default.
We are looking for a hands-on DevOps/Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) to design,
build, and operate the cloud and platform foundations of ZDP. You will help
shape the front door to Zama’s privacy-preserving technology. Your work will
remove complexity for developers, accelerate internal iteration, and underpin
how confidential applications get built and scaled.
What you will do
Own and operate the Zama Developer Platform API management layer and
developer portal, including API key lifecycle, rate limits, quotas, and tenant
policies.
Write and maintain small services, CLIs and gateway plugins for the
platform, primarily in Go or Rust, with tests and code reviews.
Build reliable CI/CD, environment isolation, and release automation that
supports frequent, safe changes for ZDP Relayer, client SDKs, and other
components.
Establish end-to-end observability with structured logs, metrics, traces,
SLOs, and actionable alerting, then iterate based on what you learn.
Deliver security-by-default: least-privilege access, secrets management,
strong authentication on admin surfaces, audit trails, and appropriate edge
protections.
Create and maintain runbooks, contribute to on-call and incident response,
and drive post-incident improvements.
API Platform Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) 1
Reduce toil by automating runbooks and incident tooling, including load and
failure testing.
Profile performance and cost across the stack and make pragmatic
optimisations.
Shape our approach to multi-region and horizontal scaling, including data
residency considerations such as GDPR and disaster recovery.
Collaborate widely, contribute to technical direction, and help improve
engineering practices over time.
What you will bring
5+ years in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), DevOps, or platform
engineering roles.
Strong knowledge of DevOps for blockchain infrastructure, especially for
Ethereum-based blockchains, primarily on AWS.
Experience with API management platforms such as Tyk, Kong Konnect, or
WSO2, including custom policies or plugins.
Familiarity with identity platforms (IdPs) such as Auth0, Okta, Keycloak,
LogTo etc and configuring identity/authorization engines for OpenID
Connect (OIDC), OAuth 2.0, and service-to-service auth.
Ability to build production-grade tooling or small services in Go or Rust,
plus a scripting language such as Python or TypeScript.
Strong infrastructure as code skills, for example Terraform/OpenTofu,
Terragrunt, or Pulumi.
Nice to have
Knowledge of applying Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF), API
management, and Page Rules engine for traffic management.
Competence with CI/CD (for example GitHub Actions) and release
engineering.
Practical knowledge of observability stacks and SLO-driven operations.
Prior experience with creating/managing runbooks for on-call operations.
API Platform Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) 2
Hands-on experience of load testing, chaos testing, or failure-injection
testing.
Familiarity with cost and performance tuning through code changes, not
only instance sizing.
Only candidates based in +/-4 hours of UTC are suitable for this role.
